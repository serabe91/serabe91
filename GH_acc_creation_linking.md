## **2. How to Link our Account to the UNAL organization**
### **Step 1: Access GitHub Education**
1. Go to [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/).
2. Click **Join GitHub Education**.
### **Step 2: Verify Our Educational Affiliation**
1. Log in with your GitHub account.
2. Provide the following information: 
   - **Institutional email**: Enter your email address associated with your educational institution.
   - **Verification document**: Attach an official document proving your affiliation (e.g., student ID, enrollment letter, etc.).
     (in my case, I had to print my registration certificate from SIA and take a photo holding it because, attachment option was
     not available, and our student card hasnÂ´t a date to verify current enrollment).

3. Click **Submit Request**.

### **Step 3: Wait for Approval**
- The verification process may take 1-5 business days. You will receive an email once approved.
  (When I had to wait for approval, the verification process was ready the following day).
